Many conveyors have different and unique features and uses, so that hazards vary due Wristlets Point of Operation Press Bed to the material conveyed, the location of the con- veyor, and the proximity of the conveyer to the employees. Types include unpowered and pow- ered, live roller, slat, chain, screw, and pneumatic. Conveyors eliminate or reduce manual material handling tasks, but they present amputation haz- ards associated with mechanical motion. (See Figures 27 through 30for examples of common conveyors.)

Press brake operation is either mechanical or hydraulic. Press brakes are either general-purpose or spe- cial-purpose brakes, according to ANSI B11.3-2002, Safety Requirements for Power Press Brakes. General purpose press brakes have a single opera- tor control station. A servo-system activates the special purpose brake, which may be equipped with multiple operator/helper control stations.

Many conveyors have different and unique features and uses, so that hazards vary due Wristlets Point of Operation Press Bed to the material conveyed, the location of the con- veyor, and the proximity of the conveyer to the employees. Types include unpowered and pow- ered, live roller, slat, chain, screw, and pneumatic. Conveyors eliminate or reduce manual material handling tasks, but they present amputation haz- ards associated with mechanical motion. (See Figures 27 through 30for examples of common conveyors.) Conveyor-related injuries typically involve a employee’s hands or fingers becoming caught in nip points or shear points on conveyors and may occur in these situations: • Cleaning and maintaining a conveyor, especially when it is still operating. • Reaching into an in-going nip point to remove debris or to free jammed material. •",

For other slicers, they should use the feeding attachment located on the food-holder. • Never place food into the slicer by hand-feeding or hand pressure. • Instruct operators to retract the slicer blade dur- ing cleaning operations. • Instruct operators to turn off and unplug slicers when not in use or when left unattended for any period of time. • Perform servicing and maintenance under an energy control program in accordance with the Control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout),29 CFR 1910.147, standard.

Hazards of Food Slicers Food slicers are electrically powered machines typi- cally equipped with a rotary blade, an on/off switch, thickness adjustment, and a food holder or chute. A On/Off Switch Meat Holder Thickness Adjustment Rotating Blade Case History #15 An employee was cleaning a meat slicer that was turned off but was still plugged in. He inadver- tently turned the machine on by bumping the on/off switch, resulting in an amputation of his right ring finger. Safeguarding and Other Controls for Food Slicers Food slicers must be used with guards that cover the unused portions of the slicer blade on both the top and bottom of the slicer. You should buy slicers already equipped with a feeding attachment on the sliding mechanism of the food holder or purchase the attachment separately and install it before use. Instruct employees to use a pushing/guarding de- vice with chute-fed slicers. The following are some secondary safeguarding",

(See Figure 37.) Figure 37 Meat Slicer Amputations resulting from work with food slicers can occur as follows: • When the operator adjusts or services the slicer while it is still operating or while it is switched off but still plugged in, or energized. In the latter case, amputations occur when the operator acci- dentally switches the slicer on. • When the operator fails to use the sliding attach- ment on the food-holding device, especially when slicing small pieces of meat. • When the operator hand-feeds food into a chute-fed slicer without using the proper push- ing/guarding device or plunger.

The assistant was holding a box of turkey in a tilted position while the operator fed the turkey into the slicer. The operator removed the guard from the meat slicer because the",

The purpose of lockout and tagout is to prevent the unexpected startup of the machine. Unexpected startup may be the result of various causes: a failure of the control system; an inappropriate action on a start control, sensor, contactor, or valve; a restoration of power after an interruption; or some other internal or external inﬂ uences. After completion of the lockout or tagout process, the dissipation of the energy must be veriﬁ ed. Safety Isolation Systems Safety isolation systems execute an orderly shutdown of a machine and also provide an easy method of locking off the power to a machine. This approach works well for larger machines and manufacturing systems, especially when multiple energy sources are located on a mezzanine level or at distant locations. Load Disconnects For local isolation of electrical devices, switches can be placed just prior to the device that needs to be isolated and locked out. The Bulletin 194E Load Switches are an example of a product that are capable of both isolation and lockout. Trapped Key Systems Trapped key systems are another method",
